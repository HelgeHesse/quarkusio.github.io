                In a previous blog post about Kafka and Avro, we used an emitter to send Kafka messages. In this post, we are going look at this emitter construct a little bit more closely. Injecting an Emitter Injecting an emitter is straightforward. You indicate the targeted channel, i.e., where do you...

            <description>
                Last week we became aware that the OpenJDK team in Java 15 have disabled biased locking (JEP 374) in the Java virtual machine.

                This week, I&#8217;ve been asked about a widespread use case around concurrency. This user wanted to call two microservices in parallel, and when both results are received, join them and continue the processing. Basically, the following pattern: In a non-reactive approach, both calls would block the caller thread, and, except...
